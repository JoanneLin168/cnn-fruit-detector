# cnn-fruit-detector
A convolutional neural network to detect apples, oranges and bananas

# Setup
Make sure to extract the data from the zip file and ensure that the folder structure is as follows:
```bash
├── data
│   ├── test
│   └── train
```

# Training
Currently only tested by running `fruit_detector.ipynb`. `src\engine.py` and `main.py` are not up-to-date
